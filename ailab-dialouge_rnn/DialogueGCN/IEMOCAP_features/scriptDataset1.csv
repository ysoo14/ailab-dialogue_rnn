Ses02M_impro04_M017,Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,fru

Ses03M_script01_1_M005,I could hear it right through the floor.,sad
Ses03M_script01_1_F006,"God, what was he doing out there anyway?",xxx

Ses03M_script01_1_F010,What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M009,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,ang

Ses03M_script01_1_M010,"No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.",fru
Ses03M_script01_1_M011,"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",ang
Ses03M_script01_1_M012,That we haven't had any hope for years now?,ang
Ses03M_script01_1_F012,You can't say that to him.,xxx

Ses03M_script01_1_M014,Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F014,"To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_F015,he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_M015,"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F016,No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,ang

Ses03M_script01_1_F021,"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",neu
Ses03M_script01_1_M022,Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,ang
Ses03M_script01_1_F022,Well I'm just saying--,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F023,You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_F024,She's not...she's Larry's girl.,xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M023,She's not Larry's girl.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F025,From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_M024,I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F026,"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",fru

Ses03M_script01_1_M029,Then I guess that's the end of it.,neu
Ses03M_script01_1_M030,But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,sad
Ses03M_script01_1_M031,"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",neu
Ses03M_script01_1_F030,"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...",neu
Ses03M_script01_1_M032,Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_F031,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_M033,Because it is.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F032,"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M034,It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F033,No I don't want a diagram.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F034,"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",fru
Ses03M_script01_1_M035,Alright then.,fru
Ses03M_script01_1_F035,"Look, just give it some thought okay?",xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M036,I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,sad
Ses03M_script01_1_M037,But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,neu
Ses03M_script01_1_F036,What the hell is this?,xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M038,I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,neu
Ses03M_script01_1_F037,Are you crazy?,xxx

Ses03M_script01_1_F039,"Oh, you have to be inspired.",xxx
Ses03M_script01_1_M041,Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,ang

Ses03M_script01_2_F007,"Then why is still single?  I mean there's plenty of single men in New York.  Why isn't she married by now?  Probably a hundred men has told her that she's foolish but, she's waiting.",xxx
Ses03M_script01_2_M008,How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?,neu

Ses04F_script01_3_M033,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,sad

Ses04F_script01_3_M042,I mean you can take those things out of war but,xxx
Ses04F_script01_3_M043,"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",sad

Ses04F_script02_1_M021,Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,exc

Ses04F_script02_1_F018,Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,xxx

Ses04F_script02_1_M035,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,exc
Ses04F_script02_1_M036,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,exc
Ses04F_script02_1_M037,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,exc
Ses04F_script02_1_M038,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,exc
